# Anime-Hub - Remake from my [school project](https://github.com/Swirl86/Android-Kurs/tree/main/Projekt/AnimeHub)

During my school days in 2021, I was assigned to create an Android app, and it turned out to be an incredibly fun and educational experience. It was my first Android project, and I quickly discovered how enjoyable Android development could be.

The opportunity to combine my hobbyâ€”animeâ€”with app development made the project even more exciting.

Now, I want to remake the app in Kotlin to refresh and enhance my knowledge of Android development. My goal is to dive deeper into tools like Retrofit, better understand API usage, and refine my skills with modern Android development practices.

### Work in Progress / WIP ðŸš§

This project is currently a work in progress. My focus is on building a solid foundation with modern Android architecture and incorporating best practices to ensure scalability and maintainability. More features and improvements are planned for future iterations.
